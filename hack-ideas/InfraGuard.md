## **Project Title:** InfraGuard â€“ Autonomous Infrastructure Validation, Recommendation & Diagramming Agent

### **Overview**
InfraGuard is a GenAI-powered agent that automates infrastructure validation, generates architecture recommendations, and creates compliant diagrams based on enterprise standards and project-specific needs. This solution accelerates infrastructure readiness, ensures compliance, and enhances collaboration across engineering and architecture teams.

### **Problem Statement**
Infrastructure setup and documentation are often manual, inconsistent, and error-prone. Teams lack intelligent tools to validate configurations, generate compliant recommendations, and produce accurate architecture diagrams aligned with enterprise standards.

### **Objectives**
- Automate validation of infrastructure setup against approved architecture guidelines.
- Generate infrastructure recommendations using GenAI based on project requirements and standards.
- Automatically generate architecture diagrams from validated configurations.
- Validate architecture diagrams for accuracy and compliance.
- Deploy infrastructure using validated configurations.
- Audit deployed resources to ensure alignment with guidelines.

### **Key Features**
1. **Guideline Integration**
   - Connect to architecture team-approved standards.
   - Parse and interpret rules for validation and recommendation.

2. **GenAI-Powered Recommendations**
   - Analyze project goals and generate infrastructure setup suggestions.
   - Tailor recommendations to match enterprise standards and best practices.

3. **Setup Validation Agent**
   - Validate proposed configurations and flag deviations.
   - Provide feedback and remediation suggestions.

4. **Automated Diagram Generation**
   - Use GenAI to generate architecture diagrams from validated configurations.
   - Ensure diagrams reflect enterprise-compliant structures and components.

5. **Architecture Diagram Validation**
   - Parse diagrams to ensure structural and component compliance.
   - Highlight mismatches and suggest corrections.

6. **Automated Deployment**
   - Deploy infrastructure using validated templates (e.g., Terraform, Bicep).
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for seamless provisioning.

7. **Post-Deployment Audit**
   - Scan deployed resources.
   - Compare against guidelines and diagrams.
   - Generate compliance and drift reports.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript
- **Tools**: Azure DevOps, Terraform, Bicep, OpenAI API, LangChain, Mermaid.js
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, Streamlit
- **Cloud**: Azure / AWS

### **Impact**
- Reduces manual effort and human error in infrastructure setup and documentation.
- Accelerates project onboarding with GenAI-driven recommendations and diagrams.
- Ensures consistent, secure, and compliant deployments.
- Empowers teams with intelligent automation and validation.

### **Team Roles**
- **Infra Architect**: Define and maintain validation guidelines.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Integrate deployment and scanning tools.
- **ML Engineer**: Build and train GenAI recommendation and diagramming engine.
- **Frontend Developer**: Create dashboard for recommendations, diagrams, validation results, and reports.
