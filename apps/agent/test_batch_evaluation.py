            Excellent color reproduction with wide color gamut. Good peak brightness for HDR content.

            Sound Quality: Built-in speakers are adequate but lack bass depth. Audio quality is
            clear for dialogue but benefits from external sound system for movies.

            Smart Platform: webOS interface is user-friendly with quick access to popular apps.
            Magic remote makes navigation intuitive. Good app support but some streaming services
            load slowly.
