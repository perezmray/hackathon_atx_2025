# Implementation Plan: Rubric CRUD UI with Navigation Drawer

## Pre-flight

- [ ] Confirm Material-UI dependencies are available for Drawer components
- [ ] Review existing rubric components and API to understand reuse opportunities
- [ ] Validate React Router is configured for new routing structure
- [ ] Confirm TypeScript types for rubric and criteria models

## Navigation Infrastructure

- [ ] Create navigation drawer component (`src/components/navigation/NavigationDrawer.tsx`)
- [ ] Update `AppLayout.tsx` to include navigation drawer with responsive behavior
- [ ] Add navigation menu items for Home, Decision Kits, and Rubrics
- [ ] Implement drawer toggle functionality for mobile devices
- [ ] Style navigation drawer to match existing design system

## API Enhancement

- [ ] Extend `src/api/rubrics.ts` with missing CRUD operations:
  - [ ] `createRubric(rubric: Partial<Rubric>): Promise<Rubric>`
  - [ ] `updateRubric(id: string, updates: Partial<Rubric>): Promise<Rubric>`
  - [ ] `deleteRubric(id: string): Promise<void>`
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states for new API operations
- [ ] Implement proper cache invalidation for rubric operations
- [ ] Add API integration for criteria selection during rubric creation

## Rubric Pages Implementation

- [ ] Create `src/pages/rubrics/` directory structure
- [ ] Implement `RubricsListPage.tsx`:
  - [ ] Fetch and display all rubrics using enhanced `RubricList` component
  - [ ] Add "Create Rubric" button with navigation to create page
  - [ ] Implement search/filter functionality for rubrics
  - [ ] Add edit/delete actions for each rubric item
- [ ] Implement `RubricDetailPage.tsx`:
  - [ ] Display rubric details using `RubricDetail` component
  - [ ] Show associated criteria with proper formatting
  - [ ] Add edit and delete action buttons
  - [ ] Implement breadcrumb navigation
- [ ] Implement `AddEditRubricPage.tsx`:
  - [ ] Use enhanced `RubricForm` component for both create and edit modes
  - [ ] Implement criteria selection interface
  - [ ] Add form validation and error handling
  - [ ] Handle navigation after successful create/update operations

## Component Enhancements

- [ ] Enhance `RubricForm.tsx` for standalone use:
  - [ ] Add criteria selection functionality
  - [ ] Implement proper form validation
  - [ ] Add loading states and error handling
  - [ ] Support both create and edit modes
- [ ] Enhance `RubricList.tsx`:
  - [ ] Add edit and delete action buttons
  - [ ] Implement confirmation dialogs for delete operations
  - [ ] Add loading and empty states
  - [ ] Optimize for mobile display
- [ ] Create confirmation dialog component for rubric deletion
- [ ] Ensure all components follow accessibility guidelines

## Routing Integration

- [ ] Update `src/pages/App.tsx` with new rubric routes:
  - [ ] `/rubrics` - Rubrics list page
  - [ ] `/rubrics/new` - Create rubric page
  - [ ] `/rubrics/:id` - Rubric detail page
  - [ ] `/rubrics/:id/edit` - Edit rubric page
- [ ] Implement proper route guards and error boundaries
- [ ] Add 404 handling for invalid rubric IDs
- [ ] Update navigation links to use new routing structure

## Validation and Error Handling

- [ ] Add client-side validation for rubric forms (name, description, criteria selection)
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for rubric pages
- [ ] Add loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Handle network errors and API failures gracefully
- [ ] Add success/error notifications for CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for new rubric page components:
  - [ ] `RubricsListPage.test.tsx`
  - [ ] `RubricDetailPage.test.tsx`
  - [ ] `AddEditRubricPage.test.tsx`
- [ ] Unit tests for enhanced API operations in `rubrics.ts`
- [ ] Unit tests for navigation drawer component
- [ ] Integration tests for rubric CRUD workflows:
  - [ ] Create rubric end-to-end flow
  - [ ] Edit rubric end-to-end flow
  - [ ] Delete rubric with confirmation flow
- [ ] Responsive design tests for mobile and tablet viewports
- [ ] Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Documentation and Cleanup

- [ ] Update `README.md` with new navigation and rubric management features
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for new components and API functions
- [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces if needed
- [ ] Remove any unused imports or code
- [ ] Ensure consistent code formatting and linting compliance

## Rollout Validation

- [ ] Test navigation drawer functionality across different screen sizes
- [ ] Validate rubric CRUD operations work end-to-end
- [ ] Confirm existing decision kit functionality remains intact
- [ ] Test performance with large numbers of rubrics and criteria
- [ ] Validate proper error handling for edge cases (network failures, invalid data)
- [ ] Confirm mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance
