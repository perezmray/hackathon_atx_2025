# Feature Plan: Rubric UI with Criteria Collection

## Problem
The current React UI only supports individual criteria management. To support document analysis workflows, users need to create, view, update, and delete rubrics, each composed of a collection of criteria. The UI must interact with the existing Rubric API.

## Goals
- Allow users to create, view, update, and delete rubrics.
- Each rubric contains a name, description, and a collection of criteria.
- Integrate with the Rubric API for all CRUD operations.
- Enable users to select criteria when building a rubric.

## Design
- Extend the UI to support rubric management (list, detail, form).
- Fetch available criteria from the Criteria API for rubric composition.
- Use React Context or state management for rubrics and criteria.
- UI components:
  - Rubric List (view all rubrics)
  - Rubric Form (add/edit rubric, select criteria)
  - Rubric Detail (view rubric and its criteria)
- API integration for rubrics and criteria.
- Form validation and user feedback.

## Impacted Code
- React UI codebase in `webapp/` directory.
- New components and API service modules for rubrics.

## Tests
- Unit tests for rubric components and API logic.
- Integration tests for rubric CRUD flows.

## Rollout
- Initial rollout as an extension to the existing criteria UI.
- Future enhancements for rubric sharing and advanced analysis.
