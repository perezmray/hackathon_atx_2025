# Feature Plan: Criteria CRUD UI for Document Analysis Agent

## Problem
There is a need for a user-friendly front-end to capture and manage criteria that an agent will use to analyze documents. Each criterion should have a name, description, and a potentially long definition. Users must be able to add, view, update, and delete criteria efficiently.

## Goals
- Provide a modern, responsive UI for managing criteria.
- Support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Ensure criteria can have long, detailed definitions.
- Use React (with Vite) and Yarn for the front-end stack.

## Design
- Use React with Vite for fast development and hot reloading.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- State management via React Context or a lightweight library.
- UI library: Material UI, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Components:
  - Criteria List (view all)
  - Criteria Form (add/edit)
  - Criteria Detail (view one)
- Form validation and user feedback.

## Impacted Code
- New codebase in `webapp/` directory.
- No existing code will be impacted.

## Tests
- Unit tests for components and state logic.
- Integration tests for user flows (add, edit, delete).

## Rollout
- Initial rollout as a standalone front-end.
- Future integration with backend API for persistent storage.
