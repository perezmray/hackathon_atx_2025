# GitHub Issue: Criteria API with CosmosDB

## Summary
Implement a RESTful API to manage criteria for document analysis, using CosmosDB for storage. The API will support CRUD operations and integrate with the front-end criteria management UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API exposes endpoints for CRUD operations on criteria
- [ ] Data is persisted in CosmosDB
- [ ] Input validation and error handling are present
- [ ] Unit and integration tests are included
- [ ] API documentation is available (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] (Optional) API is secured with authentication

## Additional Notes
- Technology stack: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI (TBD)
- Data model: id, name, description, definition
